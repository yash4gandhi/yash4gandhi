### Hi there ðŸ‘‹<br><br>

## My experience in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing:

Research Experience:<br>
Unsupervised WhatsApp Fake News Detection Using Semantic Search: https://github.com/yash4gandhi/Unsupervised-WhatsApp-fake-news-detection-using-semantic-search : I worked on determining the authenticity of messages forwarded on WhatsApp messenger using a semantic search based approach by applying BERT transfer learning model.
<br><br>
Apart from that I have taken the following academic courses to learn the fundamentals of Machine Learning:
<br>
DSCI 552: Machine Learning: https://github.com/yash4gandhi/Machine_Learning_at_USC
Focus:  Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Regression methods. Resampling methods, including cross-validation and bootstrap. Decision trees, dimensionality reduction, regularization, clustering, and kernel methods. Hidden Markov models and graphical models. Feedforward and recurrent neural networks and deep learning.
<br><br>
Soft Computing: https://github.com/yash4gandhi/Soft_Somputing :
Focus: Neural Networks, Back Propagation, Genetic Algorithm, Fuzzy Control Systems, Deep Learning, Autoencorders.
<br><br>
Certification course by Fractal Analytics on Machine Learning and Data Analysis:https://github.com/yash4gandhi/Machine_Learning_and_Data_Analysis_by-Fractal_Analytics
